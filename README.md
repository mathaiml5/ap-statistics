For many people, buying a home is one of life’s major milestones. Not only is it a significant financial commitment, but it is also a symbol of their self-worth. 
For some, buying a home is purely an investment opportunity from which they plan to earn profits or use as a means to build wealth. 
The features or desirable charactersitics of a home (i.e. location, layout, size) can shape a person’s lifestyle and influence how happy they are in their homes. 
For some of the proud homeowners, the housing booms have been a boon but for others saving up enough money to make a down payment and choosing the right property 
that matches their needs can be a difficult task. In either case, what people want to know is: Is a particular home worth it? Naturally, home prices vary depending 
on the size, layout, amenities, among other property characteristics and fluctuate over time. With so many attributes, it can be difficult to get a clear idea of 
what a fair price range for a home is. Inspired by discussions in the class and what we learned while studying statistics, I want to explore the question of 
whether it is possible to understand what are the key drivers of home prices (i.e.) what are the different factors that drive the price of a home and whether 
we can identify and use the attributes to create a statistical model to predict its price.

In this project we will explore how we can create a model of current prices of various types of homes in a location, apply multiple regression modeling techniques 
we learnt in AP Statistics class to ascertain which factors drive home prices and help potential buyers assess what the homes they are considering buying are worth.
For the analysis we will be using a public data sets available such as Ames Housing Data (De Cock 2011). The Ames dataset contains 80 variables describing 2930 
property sales that had taken place in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010.

We will perform exploratory analysis to describe various decscriptive statistics of the dataset, perform any data cleanup, and then build and tested 3 different 
regression models and a machine learning model based on random forest algorithm as part of my analysis of the Ames dataset. We will use R notebooks in the R Studio
software to generate the reports and data summaries and to build and test the models for home price prediction.

## Future Extension 
For those of us living in the San Francisco Bay Area, home prices have climbed up steeply. According to St. Louis Fed, between 2000-2019 
while the broader national stock and housing market indices have climbed only 100% in the same period our home price indices have skyrocketed over 150%!
But with the recent COVID pandemic, the surge in pricing has cooled off a bit. As a future extension, I want to build a similar model using Python 
to get data from various listing services such as MLS and Zillow. For those that owned homes already this has been a boon but for new residents, it is very 
difficult to save up enough money to make a down payment and even find the right property that matches their needs. I want to extend the ideas from the Ames dataset and build models using Python for various supervised learning models and OLS regression.
